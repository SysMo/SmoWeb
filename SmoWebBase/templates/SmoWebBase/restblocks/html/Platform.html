<h1>What is SmoWeb?</h1>
<p>SmoWeb is a computational platform, facilitating the creation of mathematical models.
We are particularly interested in physical models used in engineering design.
The simplest models contain a number of numerical input fields, and a number of result fields.
More advanced models can contain multiple field groups, arranged in a hierarchical structure.
The inputs can be physical quantities, true/false values, choices; resizable arrays, child objects with their own field structure and tables.
Fields can be dynamically hidden or shown based on values of other fields.
The result data can be presented to the user as quantity fields, tables and graphs.
The models can be of arbitrary complexity, ranging from simple arithmetic to 3D transient simulations,
based on finite elements/volumes methods.</p>
