<h1>Open source license</h1>
<p>If you choose the GPL option, you are allowed to use our code at your will,
read, review, modify or contribute code to the platform or develop your own
version of the platform, provided that you comply with the copyleft restrictions
of the GPL licence. This means that in order to guarantee the freedom
of the software and the users, if any such modifications
are going to be made for public use (e.g. published on a domain other than
sysmoltd.com, whether paid or free), the source code behind them has to be
made public as well.</p>
<p>We have not yet published officially the source code, so if you need it please

<h1>Models</h1>
<p>The license does not concern proprietary models which can be created on top
of the platform and have limited user access (requiring access credentials).
Such models do not have to reveal their code, as long as they are meant to be
used only by their authors and their clients, if they are contracted by
external entities.</p>
