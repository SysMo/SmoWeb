<h1>What we believe</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept,
you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer.&quot;</p>
<p class="attribution">&mdash;Richard Stallman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We firmly believe in <strong>Free and Open Source Software</strong>. Open source gives you the freedom to use, modify, improve
and re-distribute your product at your discretion. Time and time again Open Source proves to
be viable, and often superior alternative to commercial closed source software. Open
Source guarantees that the software you use will be independant and provided it has
a thriving community, will continue to develop and improve.</p>
<p>Science, engineering, technology are all collective achievements and we stand tall
because, because we step on the shoulders of the ones before us. Mathematical libraries,
equation solvers, mesh generators, pre- and post-processing tools, parallelization software,
network tools, databases, encryption tools, virtually everything is out there,
already available, very often at no cost. Why not use it? Why not give back our own share?</p>
<p>Of course, we realize Open Source is not always applicable. We don't expect that everyone
believes in it the way we do, so we are ready and willing to protect the know-how of
our clients by all means possible.</p>
