<p>We can model complex circuits in the thermal, fluid, mechanical, electrical and other domains.
These simulations are typically transient, showing the development of various system variables over time.
The CO2 heat pump shown here, for example, consists of a compressor, condenser, expansion valve, evaportor
and recuperator (counterflow heat exchanger). The different componnents are laid out graphically
and are interconnected. After the simulation run, some results are shown on the graph. In this case we
were interested in the temperatures at the different parts of the system.</p>

<p>The components used in system simulations are taken from various libraries of componets. These can include
individual software libraries (e.g. AMESim Thermal Library) or standard libraries (Modelica Standard Library).
Sometimes, however, no component exists for the particular need. In this case we can develop a new component
model based on an analytical physical model, empirical correlations or interpolation. The models can be developed
either in C/C++ or in the Modelica language.</p>

<p>When heat exchange processes, mechanical stresses or fluid flow occur in an object of complex geometry,
the only way to accurately predict the object's behaviour is to use some form of FEM (finite element model).
The geometrical object (or objects) has to be partitioned into simple elements (e.g. tetrahedrals, prisms or
hexahedrals, triangles, quadrangles, etc). The FEM solver finds an approximate solution to the partial differential
equations at discrete points (the vertices of the elements), and interpolates (linearly, bilinearly, quadratically etc.)
within the elements.</p>

<p>Sometimes not the temperatures, but rather the integral heat fluxes are of interest. In this case using
the standard FEM method may yield incorrect results, as it is not conservative in general. That is, the net heat
balance through all the surfaces may turn out to be non-zero (it will approach zero as the mesh gets finer, but
at the cost of increased computational time). In this case, a low-order FEM method called FVM (finite volume method)
can be used. (e.g. see SmoFlow Thermal Solver). The temperature values resulting from FVM may not be as accurate,
but the heat fluxes are guaranteed to be conserved.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Mechanical finite element modeling</a></h2>
<p>Mechanical FEM is typically used to find the critical stresses in a component as a result of mechanical loads.
Because stresses are high-order quantities (they depend on the derivative of the displacement), a higher-order FEM
method is usually used (e.g. quadratic interpolation in space). Some materials are also anisotropic (that is,
stronger in one direction than in others), which complicates additionally the calculation.</p>
<p>There are two different types of mechanical analysis:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Steady state: constant loads/displacements are applied to the component. Results are stresses/strains</li>
<li>Eigenmode (resonant): oscillating loads are applied to the component. Results are stresses/strains and resonant frequencies</li>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)</a></h2>
<p>Fluid processes modeling is an absolute necessity in many egineering designs. Pressure drop, heat exchange,
separation and  mixing are complex phenomena, affecting the performance of pumps, valves, turbines, reaction
chambers and many other systems. A modification of FEM, called Finite Volume Method, is typically used to describe
the transport of mass, momentum, energy, turbulence, etc. occuring in fluids.</p>

<p>Although the finite volumes method is primarily used for fluid flow, it is applicable to every problem which
involves transport of mass and energy. Multiphysics models involving heat exchange, diffusion and advection
of materials often use finite volume models, too.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Pre- and post-processing</a></h2>
<p>Whether commercial or open-source sofware is used, the steps involved in the solution process are quite the same.
First, a mesh is created in order to partition the component geometry. Then the mesh is used as input to the solver
together with additional user input (material properties, boudary conditions, initial conditions, etc.). Finally,
the results from the solver are inspected and processed to extract valuable data (e.g. temperature at a given point,
heat flux at a boundary, position and value of the maximal stress, etc.).</p>
<p>Various software tools can be used in the pre- and post-processing steps. Each commercial software typically has
its own tools (e.g. CFX Pre and CFX Post). There are some &quot;standard&quot; open-source tools which are used by many solvers.
For mesh generation the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.salome-platform.org/" target="_self">Salome platform</a> (integrating many different meshing algorithms) or <a class="reference external" href="http://geuz.org/gmsh/" target="_self">GMSH</a> can be used.
For post-processing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.paraview.org/" target="_self">ParaView</a> is the de-facto standard. (Mayavi2 is another alternative, also based on the Visualization Toolkit - VTK)</p>
