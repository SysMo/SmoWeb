Open software and hardware development

Who we are
----------

A team of young and motivated engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists,
providing services in engineering modeling and technical software development.s

What we can do
--------------

* create computer models of engineering systems
* model energy and mass exchange, fluid and heat flow
* extend and customize existing simulation products
* create new software products for modeling and simulation

What is special about us
------------------------

* we can develop modeling tools customized to meet you needs
* we can combine, customize and automate existing modeling tools

What we believe
---------------

   "Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, 
   you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer."
   
   -- Richard Stallman

We firmly believe in **free and open source software**. Open source gives you the freedom to use, modify, improve
and re-distribute your product at your discretion. Time and again, open source has proven to 
be a viable, and often superior, alternative to commercial closed source software. Open
source guarantees that the software you use will be independent and given that it is backed by
a thriving community, it is bound to continue to develop and improve.

Science, engineering and technology are all collective achievements, and we stand tall 
because we stand on the shoulders of those before us. Mathematical libraries, 
equation solvers, mesh generators, pre- and post-processing tools, parallelization software,
network tools, databases and encryption tools - virtually everything is already out there,
readily available and very often at no cost. Why not use it? Why not contribute our own share?

Of course, we realize that open source is not always applicable. We don't expect that everyone
should believe in it the way we do, so we are ready and willing to protect the know-how of
our clients by all means possible.
