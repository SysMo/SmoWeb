<div class="section" id="compressor">
<h1>Compressor</h1>
<p>There are two compressor models: isothermal and isentropic. They represent the two
extremes in terms of heat exchange with the environment.</p>
<p>An isentropic compressor compresses the fluid adiabatically (without exchanging heat with
the environment). This model approximates a very quick compression model, where there is
not enough time for significant heat exchange with the environment. The outlet state of an
ideal isentropic heat exchanger has the same entropy as the inlet state. In reality, due
to friction and other irreversible processes, the entropy increases and the real work is
higher than the ideal work, which is given by:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
w_{id} = h\left(p_2, s_1\right) - h\left(p_1, s_1\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The isentropic efficiency of the compressor <span class="math">\(\eta\)</span> is a parameter of the compressor such that:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
w_{r} = w_{id} / \eta
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(w_{r}\)</span> is the real specific work. A second parameter <span class="math">\(f_Q\)</span> defines the fraction
of the work that is dissipated as heat in the environment:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
q_{out} = w_{r} \cdot f_Q
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Finally, the real outlet state of the compressor can be computed by outlet pressure and specific enthalpy,
where the specific enthalpy is determined by the energy balance:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
h_{out} = h_{in} + w_{r} - q_{out}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>An isothermal compressor compresses
the fluid (gas or liquid) at constant (ambient) temperature. It is the most efficient way
of compressing fluid (minimal work), although it is not feasible. The compression
process has to be very slow in order for the temperature to constantly equilibrate with the
environment. To approach isothermal compression in practice, a multiple-stage compressor with
intercoolers can be used.</p>
<p>The heat flow to the environment is linked to the entropy change:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
q_{out} = T * \left( s_{out} - s_{in} \right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Then the work is given by:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
w_{r} = h_{out} - h_{in} + q_{out}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="turbine">
<h1>Turbine</h1>
<p>The ideal turbine is also isentropic. A real turbine produces less work:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
w_{r} = \eta\cdot w_{id}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The change of enthalpy is:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
h_{out} = h_{in} + w_{r} - q_{out}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="throttle-joule-thompson-valve">
<h1>Throttle (Joule-Thompson) valve</h1>
<p>Expansion through an orifice or capilary tube is isenthalpic (adiabatic and no work is produced).
Therefore</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
h_{out} = h_{in}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>However, the temperature could decrease (near the two-phase region) or sometimes
increase (at high pressures and temperatures).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evaporator-condenser">
<h1>Evaporator / Condenser</h1>
<p>Pressure drop is neglected. No work is done, so the change of enthalpy is equal to the heat
input to the fluid.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="two-stream-heat-exchanger">
<h1>Two-stream heat exchanger</h1>
<p>This is a general abstraction of a few different heat exchanger design concepts. The heat exchangers could be counter-flow,
parallel-flow and cross-flow. The heat capacity flows are defined as:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{\dot Q}_1 = {\dot m}_1 \left( h(T_{2}^{in}, p_1) - h_{1}^{in} \right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{\dot Q}_2 = {\dot m}_2 \left( h(T_{1}^{in}, p_2) - h_{2}^{in} \right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The maximal heat flow rate is the lesser of the two:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{\dot Q}_{max} = \min \left( {\dot Q}_1, {\dot Q}_2 \right)
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Then the real heat flow rate is:</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
{\dot Q} = \varepsilon \cdot {\dot Q}_{max}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> is the efficiency of the heat exchanger.</p>
</div>
</div>
